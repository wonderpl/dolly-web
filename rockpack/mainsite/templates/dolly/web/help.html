        <h3>What is Wonder Place?</h3>
        <p>Wonder Place is an iOS app that makes it easy to discover, share and follow video playlists called collections. You can follow collections created by friends or experts to discover the videos you find interesting. Add your favourite videos to your own collections  and share them with friends.</p>

        <h3>How do I choose my cover image?</h3>
        <p>Your cover image is the background for your Profile, which other people will see when they are discovering new collections, so, it’s always best to choose a unique and personal cover. We choose one for you until you have a chance to change it. You can upload any picture from your camera roll or take a new photo.</p>

        <p>If you find a collection you like, have a look at the other collections created by that user – you might like them too! You can also search for specific users.</p>

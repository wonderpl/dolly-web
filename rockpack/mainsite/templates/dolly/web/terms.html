When delivering advertising we will only use information that identifies you as set out in our Privacy Policy (www.wonderpl.com/privacy).</p>
<p><strong>Ending our relationship</strong></p>
<p>If at any time you do not feel that you can agree to these Terms of Service or any changes made to the Terms of Service or the Service, you must immediately stop using the Service.</p>
<p>If you wish to end your use of the Service, please follow these instructions for deactivating your account in the settings feature of our Service.</p>
<p>If you fail to pay any sum due to us and such sum remains outstanding for a further fourteen (14) days following notice requiring such sum to be paid we may cancel your Account immediately by notice and without responsibility to you.</p>
<p>We may immediately end your use of the Service if you break the Rules of Acceptable Use, any other important rule(s), or terms and conditions we set for accessing and using the Service including these Terms of Service.</p>
<p>We may also withdraw the Service as long as we give you reasonable notice that we plan to do this so that you have a reasonable period of time to download any of your User Content.</p>
<p>If you or we end your use of the Service or we withdraw the Service as described in this section, we may delete or modify your User Content, account or any other information we hold about you. You will also lose any rights you have to use the Service or access our content or your User Content. We will not offer you compensation for any losses.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: User Content and In-Service Purchases</strong></p>
<p>Our Service makes available User Content and we do not produce User Content and cannot be responsible for it in anyway.</p>
<p>Where you follow a link to other sites or resources and make a purchase from that site or resource the purchase is solely between you and the seller. Complaints, questions and claims related to the sale item should be directed to the seller.</p>
<p>We are not the seller of any item you purchase from third parties, we have no control and do not give any commitment relating to the existence, quality, genuineness of the item, the truth or accuracy of the picture or description of the item or any other content made available by the third party.</p>
<p><strong>Our liability/responsibility to you</strong></p>
<p>If you are using the Paid Content Partner Service, Wonder PL will use commercially reasonable endeavours to make the Paid Content Partner Service available except for:</p>
<p>planned maintenance for which 24 hours notice will be given; or</p>
<p>unscheduled maintenance during normal business hours (UK time) or otherwise, for which we will use reasonable endeavours to give you advance notice.</p>
<p>Wonder PL will, as part of the Paid Content Partner Service, use reasonable endeavours to provide a level of support that is appropriate to the nature of any issues requiring support during normal business hours (UK time).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet and technology, the Service (save as set out in clause 17.2 above) is provided on an "as available" and "as is" basis. This means that we are unable to promise that your use of the Service will be uninterrupted, without delays, error-free or meet your expectations and we do not give any commitment relating to the performance or availability of the Service in these Terms of Service and, to the extent we are able to do so, we exclude any commitments that may be implied by law.</p>
<p>To the extent permitted by the law, we do not accept any responsibility whatsoever for any claims arising out of the provision of the User Service or Free Content Partner Service (as these are provided for free). In the event of a claim arising out of the provision of the Paid Service, our responsibility to you will never be more than the amount you have paid us for the use of the Service in the 12 months prior to the claim arising.</p>
<p>In every case, we will never be responsible for any loss or damage that is not reasonably foreseeable.</p>
<p><strong>Resolving disputes</strong></p>
<p>If you have a dispute with us relating to the Service, in the first instance please contact us at support@wonderpl.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that Wonder PL has not been able to resolve a dispute informally, we will discuss and agree with you the most effective way of resolving our dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the Service</strong></p>
<p>We are constantly updating and improving the Service to try and find ways to provide you with new and innovative features and services. Improvements and updates are also made to reflect changing technologies, tastes, behaviours and the way people use the Internet and our Service.</p>
<p>rder to do this, we may need to update, reset, stop offering and/or supporting a particular part of the Service, or feature relating to the Service ( <strong>changes to the Service</strong>"). These changes to the Service may affect your past activities on the Service, features that you use and your User Content ("<strong>Service elements</strong>"). Any changes to the Service could involve your Service elements being deleted or reset.</p>
<p>You agree that a key characteristic of our Service is that changes to the Service will take place over time and this is an important basis on which we grant you access to the Service. Once we have made changes to the Service, your continued use of the Service will show that you have accepted any changes to the Service. You are always free to stop using the Service or deactivate your Account in the settings feature of the Service.</p>
<p>We will try, where possible and reasonable, to contact you to let you know about any significant changes to the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to the documents</strong></p>
<p>We may revise these Terms of Service from time to time but the most current version will always be at support@wonderpl.com.</p>
<p>Changes will usually occur because of new features being added to the Service, changes in the law or where we need to clarify our position on something.</p>
<p>We will try, where possible and reasonable, to contact you to let you know about any significant changes to any of the documents referred to in these Terms of Service. We may contact you through the Service (for example by asking you to accept the changes before you continue to use the Service) or via a separate email.</p>
<p>Normally, we will try to give you some warning before the new terms become effective. However, sometimes changes will need to be made immediately and if this happens we will not give you any notice.</p>
<p><strong>Documents that apply to our relationship with you</strong></p>
<p>The current version of the Terms of Service contains the only terms and conditions that apply to our relationship with you. Older versions of the Terms of Service will no longer apply to our relationship and will be completely replaced by the current version.</p>
<p>We intend to rely on these Terms of Service as setting out the written terms of our agreement with you for the provision of the Service. If part of the Terms of Service cannot be enforced then the remainder of the Terms of Service will still apply to our relationship.</p>
<p>If you do not comply with these Terms of Service and we do not take action immediately, this does not mean we have given up any right we have and we may still take action in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Law</strong></p>
<p>As we are based in England, English law will apply to all disputes and the interpretation of these Terms of Service. The English courts will have non-exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising from or related to your use of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>Contact, feedback and complaints</strong></p>
<p>If you need to contact us in relation to these Terms of Service or any other document mentioned in them, please email us at support@wonderpl.com.</p>
<p>We value hearing from our users, and are always interested in learning about ways we can improve the Service. By providing your feedback you agree that you are giving up any rights you have in your feedback so that we may use and allow others to use it without any restriction and without any payment to you.</p>
